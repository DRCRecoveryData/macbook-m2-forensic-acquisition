# Forensic Acquisition of Apple Silicon MacBooks (M2/M3)

This repository provides documentation, step-by-step guides, and command line examples for performing forensically sound acquisitions of internal drives on Apple MacBook devices utilizing the **M2** or **M3** Apple Silicon chips.

-----

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary challenge in acquiring data from Apple Silicon devices is the secure, signed volume structure and the reliance on tools like Apple Software Restore (**asr**) for physical-to-physical imaging, often used in forensic triage or live imaging scenarios.

This guide focuses on main technical:

1.  **Live Acquisition via asr**: Creating a bit-for-bit copy of the running system to an external target.

-----

## üõ† Prerequisites

To perform a successful acquisition, you will need:

  * **Target Device**: An Apple Silicon MacBook (M1/M2/M3).
  * **External Storage**: An external drive with enough capacity to store the full image. This drive should be formatted as **APFS** or **HFS+** for optimal compatibility.
  * **Terminal Access**: Administrative (`sudo`) privileges on the target device. Crucially, the **Terminal** application must be granted **Full Disk Access** via `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access`.
  * **Caffeine**: The built-in `caffeinate` utility to prevent system sleep during the process.

## üìù Guide: Live Acquisition using `asr`

The most common method for obtaining a full-disk equivalent image in a forensically sound manner on a live macOS system is by using the **`asr`** (Apple Software Restore) utility.

### Step 1: Create a Sparse Disk Image
I understand\! You are clarifying that the original sector count, **480,724,992**, was deliberately calculated by taking a base number and adding an **extra 2,000,000 sectors** (which you incorrectly labeled as "extra\_gigabyte\_sectors").

The intended calculation, based on your clarification, is:

$$\text{Base Sectors} + \mathbf{2,000,000 \text{ extra sectors}} = 480,724,992$$

And the base number you were trying to find is:

$$\mathbf{480,724,992 - 2,000,000 = 478,724,992 \text{ sectors}}$$

## üíæ Disk Image Sector Sizing: Base Size + Buffer

This document explains the calculation used to determine the final sector count for a macOS **sparse disk image** created with the `hdiutil` command. The goal was to take a required base size and add a buffer of extra sectors to ensure the destination disk image is large enough.

---

## üî¢ The Calculation

The final sector count (`480,724,992`) was derived from the required base size plus an added buffer.

$$
\text{Base Sectors} + \text{Extra Sectors} = \text{Final Sectors}
$$

| Component | Sector Count | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Final Sectors** | **480,724,992** | The size used in the `hdiutil create` command. |
| **Extra Sectors** | **2,000,000** | The safety buffer added to the base size. |
| **Base Sectors** | **478,724,992** | The calculated minimum size required for the data. |

### Formula Used

$$
480,724,992 - 2,000,000 = \mathbf{478,724,992}
$$

## üìè Sector to Gigabyte Conversion

The term "sector" refers to a **512-byte block** of data. The addition of the **2,000,000** extra sectors translates to an added buffer of approximately **1 GB** (specifically, $1,024,000,000 \text{ bytes}$).

| Sector Count | Approximate Size (GB) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **478,724,992** | **~244.08 GB** | The minimum size required for the disk image data. |
| **+ 2,000,000** | **+ ~1.02 GB** | The buffer added to prevent boundary issues. |
| **480,724,992** | **~245.11 GB** | The final, safe, maximum virtual size for the sparse image. |

**Note:** This ensures the created disk image has a small buffer beyond the base requirement of $478,724,992$ sectors.

A **sparse disk image** (`.sparseimage`) is created to serve as the target for the acquisition. The user first created the destination directory and then the image with the specific sector count of the source disk.

```bash
drclab@drclab ~ % mkdir -p /Volumes/data/Images
drclab@drclab ~ % hdiutil create -sectors 480724992 \
    -fs APFS \
    -type SPARSE \
    -volname "disk3s1s1" \
    -o /Volumes/data/Images/disk3s1s1.sparseimage
```

  * **Log Output:**
    ```
    created: /Volumes/data/Images/disk3s1s1.sparseimage
    ```

### Step 2: Attach the Image and Identify Target

The newly created image was attached and the volume identifier was noted for the target of the `asr` command.

```bash
drclab@drclab ~ % hdiutil attach -nobrowse /Volumes/data/Images/disk3s1s1.sparseimage
```

  * **Target Volume Identification:** The sparse image volume was successfully mounted as **/dev/disk9s1** under the name `disk3s1s1`.

### Step 3: Perform the `asr` Restore (Acquisition)

The `asr restore` utility was executed using `caffeinate` to prevent system sleep.

#### Attempt 1: Using the Volume Name as Source (Failed)

The initial attempt to use the volume name path for the source failed as it was "Could not recognize" the path as an image file.

```bash
drclab@drclab ~ % sudo caffeinate -dimsu asr restore --source "/System/Volumes/Macintosh HD" --target /dev/disk9s1 --erase --noprompt
...
Could not recognize ‚Äú/System/Volumes/Macintosh HD‚Äù as an image file
```

#### Attempt 2: Using the Root Filesystem Path as Source (Successful)

The correct method of using the root filesystem path (`/`) was then successfully executed.

```bash
drclab@drclab ~ % sudo caffeinate -dimsu asr restore --source / --target /dev/disk9s1 --erase --noprompt
...
Restore completed successfully.
```

### Step 4: Detach and Convert the Image

After the acquisition completed, the sparse image volume was detached, and then converted to a compressed, read-only DMG (**UDZO**) for final storage and verification.

```bash
# Detach the volume
drclab@drclab ~ % hdiutil detach /dev/disk9s1

# Convert to a compressed DMG
drclab@drclab ~ % hdiutil convert /Volumes/data/Images/disk3s1s1.sparseimage \
    -format UDZO \
    -o /Volumes/data/Images/disk3s1s1.dmg
```

### Step 5: Acquisition Statistics and Verification Hashes

The conversion process provided detailed statistics and the necessary cryptographic hashes for the Chain of Custody document.

  * **Acquisition Statistics (from conversion log):**

      * **Total Acquisition Time**: $12\text{m } 13.748\text{s}$.
      * **Final File Size**: $169,655,418,427\text{ bytes}$.
      * **Acquisition Speed**: $261.7\text{ MB/sec}$ (MB/sec).
      * **Compression Efficiency**: $31.1\%$ savings achieved.

  * **Acquisition Integrity Hashes:**

    ```bash
    drclab@drclab ~ % md5 /Volumes/data/Images/disk3s1s1.dmg
    MD5 = 71eb365002639bd81b26c5cb5c6946c6

    drclab@drclab ~ % shasum -a 1 /Volumes/data/Images/disk3s1s1.dmg
    SHA-1 = c39ac5a93b5a25f33d457af4946fc536cee50f2b
    
    drclab@drclab ~ % shasum -a 256 /Volumes/data/Images/disk3s1s1.dmg
    SHA256 = e51f38054c383107632f4d9302a1035bd009ed8e0df3f349e1008469e36e6d46
    ```

    The **MD5 hash** of **`71eb365002639bd81b26c5cb5c6946c6`** must be recorded as the initial integrity check.

## üí° Note on Tool Selection

The choice of forensic imaging tool often depends on the operating system of the target device, the specific legal requirements of the case, and the investigator's need for advanced features like remote acquisition, cloud data extraction, or specialized chip support (e.g., Apple's T2 and M-series chips).

* **Commercial Tools** (Cellebrite, Recon ITR, LLIMAGER) typically offer vendor support, court-validated methodologies, and the ability to overcome complex security measures on newer devices.
* **Open-Source Tools** (FUJI) are often free, customizable, and backed by a community, making them excellent for initial triage, logical acquisitions, and academic use.
